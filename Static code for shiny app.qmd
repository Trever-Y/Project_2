## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r setup, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
#Read in packages
#Load libraries
library(httr)
library(jsonlite)
library(tidyverse)
library(shinydashboard)
```

query API

```{r}
data_rainfall_wind <- function(lat, lon, start_date, end_date, time_interval = "1 hours") {
  url <- "https://archive-api.open-meteo.com/v1/archive"
  response <- GET(url, query = list (
    latitude = lat,
    longitude = lon,
    start_date = start_date,
    end_date = end_date,
    hourly = "precipitation,wind_speed_10m,wind_gusts_10m",
    timezone = "auto"
  ))
  data1 <- fromJSON(content(response, as = "text"))
  
  df <- tibble(
    time = ymd_hm(data1$hourly$time),
    precipitation = data1$hourly$precipitation * 0.03937,
    wind_speed = data1$hourly$wind_speed_10m,
    wind_gust = data1$hourly$wind_gusts_10m
  )
  # add time interval
  df_hr <- df %>%
    mutate(interval = floor_date(time, time_interval)) %>%
    group_by(interval) %>%
    summarize(
      precipitation_sum = sum(precipitation, na.rm = TRUE),
      wind_speed_avg = mean(wind_speed, na.rm = TRUE),
      wind_gust_max = max(wind_gust, na.rm = TRUE),
      .groups = "drop"
    )
  
  return(df_hr)
}

#combine data sets into One
all_data <- bind_rows(rain_asheville_nc, rain_busick_nc, rain_kerrville_tx, rain_orangecounty_nc)

###manipulate data into hourly and cumulative rainfall for comparison purposes
hourly_all_data <- all_data %>%
  group_by(location) %>%
  mutate(
    hours_since_start = as.numeric(difftime(interval, min(interval), units = "hours")),
    cumulative_rainfall = cumsum(precipitation_sum)
  ) %>%
  ungroup()
```

Now, let's create some summaries from this data

```{r}
