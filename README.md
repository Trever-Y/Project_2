• Brief description of the app and its purpose.
• Packages required for this app:
library(httr)
library(jsonlite)
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
library(shinydashboard)
library(shiny)
• A line of code that would install all the packages used (so we can easily grab that and run it prior to
running your app).
• The shiny::runGitHub() code that we can copy and paste into RStudio to run your app.
